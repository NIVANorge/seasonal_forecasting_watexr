# Lake Vansjø, Norway

## Introduction to the study area

The Vansjø-Hobøl catchment lies in south-eastern Norway, in one of the most agricultural catchments in Norway. High phosphorus loading to the lake occurs because of agricultural activities and the naturally phosphorus-rich clay soils in the area. As a result, the lake has suffered from numerous toxic cyanobacteria blooms over the last two decades, leading to frequent summer bathing bans.
