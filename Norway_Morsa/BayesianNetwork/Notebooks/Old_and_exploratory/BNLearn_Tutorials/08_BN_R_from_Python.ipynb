    "And also the function listvector_to_dict(). I'm not sure how your R-package works, but bcp was returning something called an R \"list vector\", which is kind of like a dictionary, but not quite. The function above turns it into something more familiar, from which you can extract your results. Not sure how generic it is, but should give you a starting point.\""
