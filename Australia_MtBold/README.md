# Seasonal forecasting in the Mount Bold reservoir, Australia

## Introduction to the area

Mount Bold is the largest reservoir in South Australia. It receives water from the Onkaparinga catchment (325 km2)) and the Echunga Creek Catchment (32 km2). In addition, the Onkaparinga river is supplemented with water from the Murray River via a pipeline, which provides important additional water during the dry summer and autumn seasons. The Mount Bold reservoir supplies the Happy Valley reservoir further downstream, which is a drinking water reservoir for Adelaide and surroundings.

Mount Bold reservoir was included as a WATExR case study due to typically higher seasonal climate predictability in Australia than in the other European case study sites.

The primary aim was to produce seasonal predictions of water inflows to the reservoir, as seasonal variations in water level are extremely relevant for managing water release downstream, as well as pumping water from the Murray River. There are opportunities to improve reservoir management to improve water quality, in particular to avoid phosphorus resuspension and algal blooms.

## Forecasting chain

The GR6J hydrology model was used to produce seasonal streamflow forecasts for the Onkaparinga and Echunga rivers. The General Lake Model (GLM) was used to simulate the thermal dynamics of the Mount Bold reservoir. More details are given in Mercado et al. (submitted).
