**Supporting information for the paper Seasonal Forecasting to Watershed-Lake System submitted to Water Research Journal**

You will find 4 folders related to the 4 catchment-lake systems used in this paper:

1. Australia
2. Germany
3. Norway
4. Spain

On each one of these folders you will find 3 folder:

1. Atmosphere
2. Lake
3. River

In these three folders you can find all the codes, inputs and plots related to the three steps used in the methodology of the paper for each case study. This is an example for the setup used in the Spanish case study, but similar setups were used for the rest of the catchment-lake systems:
