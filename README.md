# WATExR (watexr.eu)

The WATExR project aims to deliver a series of environmental and ecological seasonal forecasting tools to the water sector within a user-friendly software environment (e.g., QGIS). The tools will employ a variety of under-the-hood lake, catchment and fish phenology models to provide stakeholders (e.g., reservoir managers/educators/fish stock assessors) with predictions of aquatic phenomena at a seasonal time-scale. Using the tools, stakeholders will have access to probabilistic aquatic forecasts driven by state-of-the-art seasonal climate projections. The tools will provide an indication of the expected average environmental conditions during the impending 3 to 9 months relative to the average conditions experienced during the most recent climate period. In so doing, the water sector will join the growing list of environmental sectors for which seasonal climate forecasts are showing strong potential to inform management; e.g., mitigating fire risk in Mediterranean shrubland (Bedia et al., 2018), and reducing southern blue-fin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) by-catch in the Southern Ocean (Hobday et al., 2011).


Case studies sites where forecasting tools are developed:

- Mt Bold reservoir, Autralia
- Burrishoole catchment, Ireland
- Sau reservoir and Ter River, Spain
- Lake Filsø/Lake Arreskov catchments, Denmark
- Vansjø-Hobøl catchment and Lake Vansjø, Norway
- Wupper reservoir, Germany
- Lake Erken, Sweden

**This repository will undergo redevelopent very soon. We will be adding more background information, instructions for accessing and using the seasonal forecasting tools and predictions for the various case study sites, as well as data developed during the project. Please come back after June 2021!**
