# Supporting information for Jackson-Blake et al. (subm.): "Seasonal forecasting to support water management at mid-high latitudes: barriers and opportunities"

Folder contents:

* HistoricEvent_Responses.csv: Questions asked as part of the first assessment exercise described in the paper (Section 3). In this exercise, stakeholders were asked to pick a historic season where there were problems in their catchment/lake, and then seasonal forecasts were produced for that season. Stakeholders were then asked a set of questions designed to firstly assess their interpretation of the forecasts, and secondly to see to what extent they thought forecasts would have been useful for them to inform management. Full questions and answers are provided in this csv.

* SEAS5_windows_of_opportunity.docx: Full details of the 'windows of opportunity' for seasonal climate forecasting using SEAS5 in the case study sites.

* WindowsOfOpportunity_Responses.xlsx: Full responses to the questionnaire described in Sections 2.5 and 4 in the paper.

A pre-proof of the paper itself will appear here once it has been peer-reviewed.
