Folder contents:

* Catchment maps for each of the five case study sites.

* SI1_FirstSurvey_HistoricEvent.pdf: Questions asked as part of the first assessment exercise described in the paper (Section 3). In this exercise, stakeholders were asked to pick a historic season when there were problems in their catchment/lake, and then seasonal forecasts were produced for that season. Stakeholders were then asked a set of questions designed to firstly assess their interpretation of the forecasts, and secondly to see to what extent they thought forecasts would have been useful for them. Full questions and answers are provided in this pdf.

* SI2_WindowsOfOpportunity_Responses.xlsx: Full responses to the questionnaire described in Sections 2.5 and 4 in the paper.
