Folder contents (Section numbers refer to the HESS paper):

* SI1_CatchmentMaps.pdf: Catchment maps for each of the five case study sites.

* SI2_FirstSurvey_HistoricEvent.pdf: Questions asked as part of the first assessment exercise described in Section 3. In this exercise, stakeholders were asked to pick a historic season when there were problems in their catchment/lake, and then seasonal forecasts were produced for that season. Stakeholders were then asked a set of questions designed to assess: (1) their interpretation of the forecasts, and (2) to what extent they thought forecasts would have been useful for them. Full questions and answers are provided in this pdf.
