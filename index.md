## Seasonal forecasting to support freshwater management

As part of the WATExR project, we have developed tools for seasonal forecasting of river discharge, lake water temperature, ecology and fish phenology. The aim is for stakeholders to have access to probabilistic aquatic forecasts driven by state-of-the-art seasonal climate projections. Forecasts provide an indication of the expected average environmental conditions during the coming 1 to 9 months, relative to the average conditions experienced during the previous 30 years.

Forecasts were developed for five pilot case studies sites, one in Australia and four in Europe:

- Mt Bold reservoir, Autralia
- Burrishoole catchment, Ireland
- Sau reservoir, Spain
- Lake Vansj√∏, Norway
- Wupper reservoir, Germany

**This repository will undergo redevelopent very soon. We will be adding more background information, instructions for accessing and using the seasonal forecasting tools and predictions for the various case study sites, as well as data developed during the project. Please come back after June 2021!**
